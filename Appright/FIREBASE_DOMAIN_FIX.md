# ðŸ”¥ URGENT: Firebase Domain Authorization Required

## ðŸš¨ **What's Happening**

You're seeing a demo account instead of Google Sign-In because your current domain isn't authorized in Firebase.

**Current Domain:** `20dbbaa523bc470e90c6b82cc1e23b82-99922a06cfef4653872f61ca4.fly.dev`

## âœ… **IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)**

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console

ðŸ‘‰ **Click this link:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/reward-coins-app-a9af0/authentication/settings

### Step 2: Scroll to "Authorized domains"

- You'll see a section called "Authorized domains"
- It currently only has `localhost` and `reward-coins-app-a9af0.firebaseapp.com`

### Step 3: Add Your Domain

- Click **"Add domain"**
- Copy and paste: `20dbbaa523bc470e90c6b82cc1e23b82-99922a06cfef4653872f61ca4.fly.dev`
- Click **"Add"**

### Step 4: Test

- Go back to your app
- Refresh the page
- Try "Sign in with Google" again
- It should now show the real Google account picker!

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Use Firebase Hosting URL**

If you want to use the official Firebase URL instead:

1. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase init hosting
   firebase deploy
   ```

2. **Use Firebase URL:**
   - Your app will be at: `https://reward-coins-app-a9af0.web.app`
   - This domain is automatically authorized

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Verify It's Working**

After adding the domain, you should see:

1. **Console logs:** "ðŸ”¥ Attempting Firebase Google Sign-In..."
2. **Google popup:** Real Google account selection
3. **Success message:** "âœ… Firebase Auth Success!" with your real email
4. **Home screen:** Your actual Google profile photo and name

## ðŸ“ž **If It Still Doesn't Work**

Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages. The new debugging will show exactly what's wrong.

**Common issues:**

- Domain not saved properly in Firebase
- Browser cache (try incognito mode)
- Firebase project permissions

## ðŸš€ **After It's Working**

Once real Google Sign-In works, all your app features will work with your real Google account:

- Your actual profile photo
- Your real name and email
- Persistent authentication across sessions

**The demo account fallback has been disabled to force real authentication.**
